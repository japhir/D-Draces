#+TITLE: Simulating D&D 5e Race Heights and Weights
#+OPTIONS: ^:{}

* D&D Character height and weight
In D&D you can roll dice to determine your character's height and weight based
on it's race.

This is the table of race size and weight in the D&D player handbook:

| Race            | Base Height | Height Modifier | Base Weight | Weight Modifier |
|-----------------+-------------+-----------------+-------------+-----------------|
| Human           | 4'8"        |           +2d10 | 110 lb.     | × (2d4) lb.     |
| Dwarf, hill     | 3'8"        |            +2d4 | 115 lb.     | × (2d6) lb.     |
| Dwarf, mountain | 4'          |            +2d4 | 130 lb.     | × (2d6) lb.     |
| Elf, high       | 4'6"        |           +2d10 | 90 lb.      | × (1d4) lb.     |
| Elf, wood       | 4'6"        |           +2d10 | 100 lb.     | × (1d4) lb.     |
| Elf, drow       | 4'5"        |            +2d6 | 75 lb.      | × (1d6) lb.     |
| Halfling        | 2'7"        |            +2d4 | 35 lb.      | × 1 lb.         |
| Dragonborn      | 5'6"        |            +2d8 | 175 lb.     | × (2d6) lb.     |
| Gnome           | 2'11"       |            +2d4 | 35 lb.      | × 1 lb.         |
| Half-elf        | 4'9"        |            +2d8 | 110 lb.     | × (2d4) lb.     |
| Half-orc        | 4'10"       |           +2d10 | 140 lb.     | × (2d6) lb.     |
| Tiefling        | 4'9"        |            +2d8 | 110 lb.     | × (2d4) lb.     |

To calculate the height, you have to add the ~Base Height~ to, e.g. 2d10 dice
rolls for the Human, which means you have to roll two 10-sided-die to determine
how much to add, in inches.

* Problem: I think metric
I don't think in terms of feet, inches, and pounds, so I thought I'd convert
some things to centimetres and kilogrammes in stead. Furthermore, I wanted to
better understand how these dice-rolls influence the final distribution of
weights and heights in the D&D universe.

And so I've simulated some dice-rolls to answer those questions!

* Tidying the data
Here I've quickly (manually) tidied the table up for use in R.

#+TBLNAME: races

NOTE: I'm using [[emacs'][emacs]] with [[https://ess.r-project.org/][ess]] in [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], and this allows me to name the
sheet with ~#+TBLNAME:~ so that I can pass it into the header argument of a
codeblock later on with ~:var dat=races~. If you don't use emacs/org-mode but,
e.g. RStudio with RMarkdown, it's easier to save the table as a csv first.

# this is so that we work in an R session in emacs with ess
#+PROPERTY: header-args:R  :session *R*

* Load libraries
First load the libraries we use here:
#+begin_src R
  library(dplyr)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(purrr)
  library(tidyr)
#+end_src

* Virtual dice
Then, let's figure out how to roll a virtual die in R. This function should do it:

#+NAME: roll-die
#+begin_src R
  roll_die <- function(n = 1, d = 20) {
    sum(sample(seq_len(d), size = n, replace = TRUE))
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: roll-die

By creating a vector of length ~d~, and sampling from it ~n~ times, with
replacement, and then taking the sum of those numbers we get simulated
dice-rolls!

Test if it works
#+begin_src R
  c(roll_die(),       # 1d20
    roll_die(1, 10),  # 1d10
    roll_die(2, 6),   # 2d6
    roll_die(2, 4))   # 2d4
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
|  6 |
|  8 |
| 10 |
|  6 |

This seems to work!

Now we need to call this function many times for the simulations. Again, we
write a wrapper function for it---this may be overkill, but hey, it's my
project!

#+NAME: replicate
#+begin_src R
  rep_dice <- function(n, d, n_sim = 1e5) {
    replicate(n_sim, roll_die(n, d))
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: replicate

* Histogram of roll results
We can have a very quick glance at what this results in by creating some
histograms for example sims.

#+begin_src R
  make_hist <- function(n, d, n_sim = 1e5) {
    data.frame(Result = rep_dice(n, d, n_sim)) %>%
      ggplot(aes(Result)) +
      geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(n, n * d, by = 1)) +
      labs(title = paste0("Histogram of ", n, "d", d, " dice rolls (", n_sim, " simulations)"))
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Let's check that we have a fair die
#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file 1d20hist.png :height 300
  make_hist(1, 20)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

[[file:1d20hist.png]]

This seems ok.

What happens if we roll 2d4?
#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file 2d4hist.png :height 300
  make_hist(2, 4)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

[[file:2d4hist.png]]

Or 2d6?
#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file 2d6hist.png :height 300
  make_hist(2, 6)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

[[file:2d6hist.png]]

* Sensible units
Now it's time to read in the data and do some simulations!

We also convert everything into sensible units.

#+begin_src R :var dat=races :colnames yes
  races <- dat %>%
    mutate(base_cm = bh_f * 30.48 + bh_i * 2.54,
           base_kg = Base.Weight * 0.4535923) %>%
    as_tibble()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

| Race            | Base.Height | bh_f | bh_i | Height.Modifier | n_height | d_height | Base.Weight | Weight.Modifier | n_weight | d_weight | base_cm |    base_kg |
|-----------------+-------------+------+------+-----------------+----------+----------+-------------+-----------------+----------+----------+---------+------------|

* Simulate many dice-rolls
Now let's simulate some dice-rolls! We're creating some new list-columns, using
~purrr::map~ and then unnesting them for easier calculations.

#+begin_src R
  races_stats  <- races %>%
    mutate(height_roll = map2(n_height, d_height, possibly(rep_dice, otherwise = 1)),
           weight_roll = map2(n_weight, d_weight, possibly(rep_dice, otherwise = 1))) %>%
    unnest(cols = c(height_roll, weight_roll)) %>%
    mutate(height = base_cm + height_roll * 2.54,  # convert roll from inches to cm
           weight = base_kg + height_roll * weight_roll * 0.4535923)  # convert rolls from lbs to kg
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Note the ~tidyr::possibly~ here, which allows me to ignore the weight rolls for
the Halfling and Gnome and instead set their value to 1.

* Averages
Then we calculate median height and weight and append them back to the original data.

We also convert Race to a factor, which is sorted by the average height.

#+begin_src R :colnames yes
  races_sum <- races_stats %>%
    group_by(Race) %>%
    summarize(height_med = median(height),
              weight_med = median(weight)) %>%
    left_join(races, by = "Race") %>%
    arrange(height_med) %>%
    mutate(Race = factor(Race, levels = Race),
           lab_kg = paste0(Height.Modifier, Weight.Modifier))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

| Race            | height_med |  weight_med | Base.Height | bh_f | bh_i | Height.Modifier | n_height | d_height | Base.Weight | Weight.Modifier | n_weight | d_weight | base_cm |    base_kg | lab_kg          |

* Plot of Heights
Great! Now let's create a plot of the average height by race, with a violin
plot to illustrate the distribution.

I further annotate the plot with base height points and which modifier was used
to get the distribution of heights.

#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file raceheights.png :width 600
  pl_h <- races_sum %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Race, y = height_med)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", alpha = .5) +
    geom_violin(aes(y = height), bw = 2.54, scale= "width", colour = NA, fill = "cornflowerblue", alpha = .8, data = races_stats) +
    geom_text(aes(y = base_cm + 2, hjust = 0, label = paste0(Height.Modifier, "'")), angle = 90) +
    geom_point(aes(y = base_cm)) +
    ylim(c(0, NA)) +
    labs(y = "Height (cm)") # +
    ## coord_flip()
  pl_h
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

[[file:raceheights.png]]

Notice the ~bw~ argument to ~geom_violin~: this is used to adjust the smoothing
kernel a bit. I've used the value to convert my units in cm back to inches,
because with lower values we get artificial jittering.

* Plot of Weights
Now we do the same for weight:
#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file raceweights.png :width 600
  pl_w <- races_sum %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Race, y = weight_med)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", alpha = .5) +
    geom_violin(aes(y = weight), bw = 1 / 0.4535923, scale= "width", colour = NA, fill = "cornflowerblue", alpha = .8, data = races_stats) +
    geom_point(aes(y = base_kg)) +
    geom_text(aes(y = base_kg, label = lab_kg), hjust = -.05, angle = 90) +
    ylim(c(0, NA)) +
    labs(y = "Weight (kg)") # +
  pl_w
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

[[file:raceweights.png]]

(Again, we set ~bw~ to the value to convert kg to lbs.)

* Combined Plot
To ultimately combine the two into one figure using ~patchwork~.

#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file races_stats.png :width 600 :height 600
  library(patchwork)
  pl <- (pl_h + labs(title = "D&D 5e Race size and weight distributions based on rolls") &
         theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
               axis.text.x = element_blank(),
               axis.ticks.x = element_blank())) /
    (pl_w & theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 30, hjust = 1, face = "bold")))
  pl
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Body Mass Index
Okay now for some more mental picturing, let's calculate the average BMI for
these races. BMI is a troublesome indicator for humans alone already, and will
certainly be wrong for the heavy-boned dwarfs, but it's nice to give us a
little bit more of a mental picture.

I found these BMI categories [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Categories][on the WikiPedia article on BMI]].

#+TBLNAME: bmi
| category                              | from |   to |
|---------------------------------------+------+------|
| Very severely underweight             |      |   15 |
| Severely underweight                  |   15 |   16 |
| Underweight                           |   16 | 18.5 |
| Normal (healthy weight)               | 18.5 |   25 |
| Overweight                            |   25 |   30 |
| Obese Class I (Moderately obese)      |   30 |   35 |
| Obese Class II (Severely obese)       |   35 |   40 |
| Obese Class III (Very severely obese) |   40 |      |

#+begin_src R :var categories=bmi :results graphics file :file races_bmi.png :width 600
  # clean up the categories
  cat <- categories %>%
    mutate(from = ifelse(is.na(from), -Inf, from),
           to = ifelse(is.na(to), Inf, to),
           category = factor(category, levels = rev(category), ordered = TRUE))

  # calculate average bmi
  bmi_avg <- races_sum %>% mutate(bmi = weight_med / (height_med/100)^2)

  # calculate all bmi's
  bmi <- races_stats %>%
    mutate(bmi = weight / (height / 100)^2)

  # plot them
  bmi_avg %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Race, y = bmi)) +
    # annotate the categories
    geom_rect(aes(xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf,
                  ymin = from,
                  ymax = to,
                  fill = category),
              inherit.aes = FALSE, data = cat) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdBu") +
    geom_violin(data = bmi, bw = .8, fill = "gray", draw_quantiles = c(.25, .5, .75)) +
    labs(fill = "BMI\nif they would have been human", y = "BMI (kg /"~m^2*")") +
    geom_point() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))

And that's it! A quick dive into some simulations with R! Any feedback on how
to improve this workflow is welcome.
